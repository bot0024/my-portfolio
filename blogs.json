The learning objectives include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understanding the basics of threat intelligence &amp; its classifications.</li>\n<li>Using UrlScan.io to scan for malicious URLs.</li>\n<li>Using Abuse.ch to track malware and botnet indicators.</li>\n<li>Investigate phishing emails using PhishTool</li>\n<li>Using Cisco\u2019s Talos Intelligence platform for intel gathering.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Answer the questions below</p>\n<p><strong>Read the description! Continue to the next\u00a0task.</strong></p>\n<h3>Task 2 Threat Intelligence</h3>\n<p>Threat Intelligence is the analysis of data and information using tools and techniques to generate meaningful patterns on how to mitigate against potential risks associated with existing or emerging threats targeting organisations, industries, sectors or governments.</p>\n<p>To mitigate against risks, we can start by trying to answer a few simple questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who\u2019s attacking you?</li>\n<li>What\u2019s their motivation?</li>\n<li>What are their capabilities?</li>\n<li>What artefacts and indicators of compromise should you look out\u00a0for?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Threat Intelligence Classifications:</h3>\n<p>Threat Intel is geared towards understanding the relationship between your operational environment and your adversary. With this in mind, we can break down threat intel into the following classifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Strategic Intel:</strong> High-level intel that looks into the organisation\u2019s threat landscape and maps out the risk areas based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that may impact business decisions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Technical Intel:</strong> Looks into evidence and artefacts of attack used by an adversary. Incident Response teams can use this intel to create a baseline attack surface to analyse and develop defence mechanisms.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tactical Intel:</strong> Assesses adversaries\u2019 tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This intel can strengthen security controls and address vulnerabilities through real-time investigations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Operational Intel:</strong> Looks into an adversary\u2019s specific motives and intent to perform an attack. Security teams may use this intel to understand the critical assets available in the organisation (people, processes, and technologies) that may be targeted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Answer the questions below</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve read on Threat Intel and the classifications</p>\n<h3>Task 3 UrlScan.io</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://urlscan.io/\"><strong>Urlscan.io</strong></a> is a free service developed to assist in scanning and analysing websites. It is used to automate the process of browsing and crawling through websites to record activities and interactions.</p>\n<p>When a URL is submitted, the information recorded includes the domains and IP addresses contacted, resources requested from the domains, a snapshot of the web page, technologies utilised and other metadata about the\u00a0website.</p>\n<p>The site provides two views, the first one showing the most recent scans performed and the second one showing current live\u00a0scans.</p>\n<p>Press enter or click to view image in full\u00a0size</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/940/0*rqNAXAnlhPU-4bqi.gif\"></figure><h3>Scan Results</h3>\n<p>URL scan results provide ample information, with the following key areas being essential to look\u00a0at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Summary:</strong> Provides general information about the URL, ranging from the identified IP address, domain registration details, page history and a screenshot of the\u00a0site.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>HTTP:</strong> Provides information on the HTTP connections made by the scanner to the site, with details about the data fetched and the file types received.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Redirects:</strong> Shows information on any identified HTTP and client-side redirects on the\u00a0site.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Links:</strong> Shows all the identified links outgoing from the site\u2019s homepage.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Behaviour:</strong> Provides details of the variables and cookies found on the site. These may be useful in identifying the frameworks used in developing the\u00a0site.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Indicators:</strong> Lists all IPs, domains and hashes associated with the site.

It was developed to identify and track malware and botnets through several operational platforms developed under the project. These platforms are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Malware Bazaar:</strong> A resource for sharing malware\u00a0samples.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Feodo Tracker:</strong> A resource used to track botnet command and control (C2) infrastructure linked with Emotet, Dridex and TrickBot.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>SSL Blacklist:</strong> A resource for collecting and providing a blocklist for malicious SSL certificates and JA3/JA3s fingerprints.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>URL Haus:</strong> A resource for sharing malware distribution sites.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Threat Fox:</strong> A resource for sharing indicators of compromise (IOCs).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let us look into these platforms individually.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://bazaar.abuse.ch/\">MalwareBazaar</a></h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, this project is an all in one malware collection and analysis database. The project supports the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Malware Samples Upload:</strong> Security analysts can upload their malware samples for analysis and build the intelligence database. This can be done through the browser or an\u00a0API.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Malware Hunting:</strong> Hunting for malware samples is possible through setting up alerts to match various elements such as tags, signatures, YARA rules, ClamAV signatures and vendor detection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Press enter or click to view image in full\u00a0size</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/806/0*TgIe6Vq5SzDc6Jq3.gif\"></figure><h3><a href=\"https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/\">FeodoTracker</a></h3>\n<p>With this project, Abuse.ch is targeting to share intelligence on botnet Command &amp; Control (C&amp;C) servers associated with Dridex, Emotes (aka Heodo), TrickBot, QakBot and BazarLoader/BazarBackdoor. This is achieved by providing a database of the C&amp;C servers that security analysts can search through and investigate any suspicious IP addresses they have come across. Additionally, they provide various IP and IOC blocklists and mitigation information to be used to prevent botnet infections.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://sslbl.abuse.ch/\">SSL Blacklist</a></h3>\n<p>Abuse.ch developed this tool to identify and detect malicious SSL connections. From these connections, SSL certificates used by botnet C2 servers would be identified and updated on a denylist that is provided for use. The denylist is also used to identify JA3 fingerprints that would help detect and block malware botnet C2 communications on the TCP\u00a0layer.</p>\n<p>You can browse through the SSL certificates and JA3 fingerprints lists or download them to add to your deny list or threat hunting rulesets.</p>\n<p>Press enter or click to view image in full\u00a0size</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/806/0*7k_68kWhrI4CozIF.gif\"></figure><h3><a href=\"https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/\">URLhaus</a></h3>\n<p>As the name points out, this tool focuses on sharing malicious URLs used for malware distribution.

You will be using the same machine through tasks 7 and\u00a08.</p>\n<p>This task will introduce you to a tool, <strong>PhishTool,</strong> that you would add to your toolkit of email analysis tools. Please take note that it would not be necessary to use it to complete the task; however, the principles learnt would be\u00a0helpful.</p>\n<h3>Email Phishing</h3>\n<p>Email phishing is one of the main precursors of any cyber attack. Unsuspecting users get duped into opening and accessing malicious files and links sent to them by email, as they appear to be legitimate. As a result, adversaries infect their victims\u2019 systems with malware, harvesting their credentials and personal data and performing other actions such as financial fraud or conducting ransomware attacks.</p>\n<p>For more information and content on phishing, check out these\u00a0rooms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails1tryoe\">Phishing Emails\u00a01</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails2rytmuv\">Phishing Emails\u00a02</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails3tryoe\">Phishing Emails\u00a03</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails4gkxh\">Phishing Emails\u00a04</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails5fgjlzxc\">Phishing Emails\u00a05</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.phishtool.com/\">PhishTool</a> seeks to elevate the perception of phishing as a severe form of attack and provide a responsive means of email security. Through email analysis, security analysts can uncover email IOCs, prevent breaches and provide forensic reports that could be used in phishing containment and training engagements.</p>\n<p>PhishTool has two accessible versions: <strong>Community</strong> and <strong>Enterprise</strong>. We shall mainly focus on the Community version and the core features in this task. Sign up for an account via this <a href=\"https://app.phishtool.com/sign-up/community\">link</a> to use the\u00a0tool.</p>\n<p>The core features\u00a0include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Perform email analysis:</strong> PhishTool retrieves metadata from phishing emails and provides analysts with the relevant explanations and capabilities to follow the email\u2019s actions, attachments, and URLs to triage the situation.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Heuristic intelligence:</strong> OSINT is baked into the tool to provide analysts with the intelligence needed to stay ahead of persistent attacks and understand what TTPs were used to evade security controls and allow the adversary to social engineer a\u00a0target.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Classification and reporting:</strong> Phishing email classifications are conducted to allow analysts to take action quickly. Additionally, reports can be generated to provide a forensic record that can be\u00a0shared.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional features are available on the Enterprise version:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage user-reported phishing\u00a0events.</li>\n<li>Report phishing email findings back to users and keep them engaged in the\u00a0process.</li>\n<li>Email stack integration with Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are presented with an upload file screen from the Analysis tab on login.

Continue to the next\u00a0task.</strong></p>\n<h3>Task 2 Threat Intelligence</h3>\n<p>Threat Intelligence is the analysis of data and information using tools and techniques to generate meaningful patterns on how to mitigate against potential risks associated with existing or emerging threats targeting organisations, industries, sectors or governments.</p>\n<p>To mitigate against risks, we can start by trying to answer a few simple questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who\u2019s attacking you?</li>\n<li>What\u2019s their motivation?</li>\n<li>What are their capabilities?</li>\n<li>What artefacts and indicators of compromise should you look out\u00a0for?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Threat Intelligence Classifications:</h3>\n<p>Threat Intel is geared towards understanding the relationship between your operational environment and your adversary. With this in mind, we can break down threat intel into the following classifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Strategic Intel:</strong> High-level intel that looks into the organisation\u2019s threat landscape and maps out the risk areas based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that may impact business decisions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Technical Intel:</strong> Looks into evidence and artefacts of attack used by an adversary. Incident Response teams can use this intel to create a baseline attack surface to analyse and develop defence mechanisms.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tactical Intel:</strong> Assesses adversaries\u2019 tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This intel can strengthen security controls and address vulnerabilities through real-time investigations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Operational Intel:</strong> Looks into an adversary\u2019s specific motives and intent to perform an attack. Security teams may use this intel to understand the critical assets available in the organisation (people, processes, and technologies) that may be targeted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Answer the questions below</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve read on Threat Intel and the classifications</p>\n<h3>Task 3 UrlScan.io</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://urlscan.io/\"><strong>Urlscan.io</strong></a> is a free service developed to assist in scanning and analysing websites.

Please take note that it would not be necessary to use it to complete the task; however, the principles learnt would be\u00a0helpful.</p>\n<h3>Email Phishing</h3>\n<p>Email phishing is one of the main precursors of any cyber attack. Unsuspecting users get duped into opening and accessing malicious files and links sent to them by email, as they appear to be legitimate. As a result, adversaries infect their victims\u2019 systems with malware, harvesting their credentials and personal data and performing other actions such as financial fraud or conducting ransomware attacks.</p>\n<p>For more information and content on phishing, check out these\u00a0rooms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails1tryoe\">Phishing Emails\u00a01</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails2rytmuv\">Phishing Emails\u00a02</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails3tryoe\">Phishing Emails\u00a03</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails4gkxh\">Phishing Emails\u00a04</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails5fgjlzxc\">Phishing Emails\u00a05</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.phishtool.com/\">PhishTool</a> seeks to elevate the perception of phishing as a severe form of attack and provide a responsive means of email security. Through email analysis, security analysts can uncover email IOCs, prevent breaches and provide forensic reports that could be used in phishing containment and training engagements.</p>\n<p>PhishTool has two accessible versions: <strong>Community</strong> and <strong>Enterprise</strong>. We shall mainly focus on the Community version and the core features in this task. Sign up for an account via this <a href=\"https://app.phishtool.com/sign-up/community\">link</a> to use the\u00a0tool.</p>\n<p>The core features\u00a0include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Perform email analysis:</strong> PhishTool retrieves metadata from phishing emails and provides analysts with the relevant explanations and capabilities to follow the email\u2019s actions, attachments, and URLs to triage the situation.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Heuristic intelligence:</strong> OSINT is baked into the tool to provide analysts with the intelligence needed to stay ahead of persistent attacks and understand what TTPs were used to evade security controls and allow the adversary to social engineer a\u00a0target.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Classification and reporting:</strong> Phishing email classifications are conducted to allow analysts to take action quickly. Additionally, reports can be generated to provide a forensic record that can be\u00a0shared.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional features are available on the Enterprise version:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage user-reported phishing\u00a0events.</li>\n<li>Report phishing email findings back to users and keep them engaged in the\u00a0process.</li>\n<li>Email stack integration with Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are presented with an upload file screen from the Analysis tab on login.

These can be utilised to protect critical assets and inform cyber security teams and management business decisions.</p>\n<p>It would be typical to use the terms \u201cdata\u201d, \u201cinformation\u201d, and \u201cintelligence\u201d interchangeably. However, let us distinguish between them to understand better how CTI comes into\u00a0play.</p>\n<p>Press enter or click to view image in full\u00a0size</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*P_z9Oglcnenq-QfF.png\"></figure><p><strong>Data:</strong> Discrete indicators associated with an adversary, such as IP addresses, URLs or\u00a0hashes.</p>\n<p><strong>Information:</strong> A combination of multiple data points that answer questions such as \u201cHow many times have employees accessed tryhackme.com within the\u00a0month?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Intelligence:</strong> The correlation of data and information to extract patterns of actions based on contextual analysis.</p>\n<p>The primary goal of CTI is to understand the relationship between your operational environment and your adversary and how to defend your environment against any attacks. You would seek this goal by developing your cyber threat context by trying to answer the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who\u2019s attacking you?</li>\n<li>What are their motivations?</li>\n<li>What are their capabilities?</li>\n<li>What artefacts and indicators of compromise (IOCs) should you look out\u00a0for?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these questions, threat intelligence would be gathered from different sources under the following categories:</p>\n<p><strong>Internal:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Corporate security events such as vulnerability assessments and incident response\u00a0reports.</li>\n<li>Cyber awareness training\u00a0reports.</li>\n<li>System logs and\u00a0events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Community:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open web\u00a0forums.</li>\n<li>Dark web communities for cybercriminals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>External</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Threat intel feeds (Commercial &amp; Open-source)</li>\n<li>Online marketplaces.</li>\n<li>Public sources include government data, publications, social media, financial and industrial assessments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Threat Intelligence Classifications</h3>\n<p>Press enter or click to view image in full\u00a0size</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*NmIZ8tJljZ62M7Fa.png\"></figure><p>Threat Intel is geared towards understanding the relationship between your operational environment and your adversary. With this in mind, we can break down threat intel into the following classifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Strategic Intel:</strong> High-level intel that looks into the organisation\u2019s threat landscape and maps out the risk areas based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that may impact business decisions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Technical Intel:</strong> Looks into evidence and artefacts of attack used by an adversary. Incident Response teams can use this intel to create a baseline attack surface to analyse and develop defence mechanisms.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tactical Intel:</strong> Assesses adversaries\u2019 tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This intel can strengthen security controls and address vulnerabilities through real-time investigations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Operational Intel:</strong> Looks into an adversary\u2019s specific motives and intent to perform an attack. Security teams may use this intel to understand the critical assets available in the organisation (people, processes and technologies) that may be targeted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Answer the questions below</em></strong></p>\n<p>2a.

The transformational process follows a six-phase cycle:</p>\n<p>Press enter or click to view image in full\u00a0size</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*qBzxDrKFJfex_4Ib.png\"></figure><h3>Direction</h3>\n<p>Every threat intel program requires to have objectives and goals defined, involving identifying the following parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information assets and business processes that require defending.</li>\n<li>Potential impact to be experienced on losing the assets or through process interruptions.</li>\n<li>Sources of data and intel to be used towards protection.</li>\n<li>Tools and resources that are required to defend the\u00a0assets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This phase also allows security analysts to pose questions related to investigating incidents.</p>\n<h3>Collection</h3>\n<p>Once objectives have been defined, security analysts will gather the required data to address them. Analysts will do this by using commercial, private and open-source resources available. Due to the volume of data analysts usually face, it is recommended to automate this phase to provide time for triaging incidents.</p>\n<h3>Processing</h3>\n<p>Raw logs, vulnerability information, malware and network traffic usually come in different formats and may be disconnected when used to investigate an incident. This phase ensures that the data is extracted, sorted, organised, correlated with appropriate tags and presented visually in a usable and understandable format to the analysts. SIEMs are valuable tools for achieving this and allow quick parsing of\u00a0data.</p>\n<h3>Analysis</h3>\n<p>Once the information aggregation is complete, security analysts must derive insights. Decisions to be made may\u00a0involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investigating a potential threat through uncovering indicators and attack patterns.</li>\n<li>Defining an action plan to avert an attack and defend the infrastructure.</li>\n<li>Strengthening security controls or justifying investment for additional resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dissemination</h3>\n<p>Different organisational stakeholders will consume the intelligence in varying languages and formats. For example, C-suite members will require a concise report covering trends in adversary activities, financial implications and strategic recommendations. At the same time, analysts will more likely inform the technical team about the threat IOCs, adversary TTPs and tactical action\u00a0plans.</p>\n<h3>Feedback</h3>\n<p>The final phase covers the most crucial part, as analysts rely on the responses provided by stakeholders to improve the threat intelligence process and implementation of security controls. Feedback should be regular interaction between teams to keep the lifecycle working.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Answer the questions below</em></strong></p>\n<p>3a.

They also allow for common terminology, which helps in collaboration and communication. Here, we briefly look at some essential standards and frameworks commonly\u00a0used.</p>\n<h3>MITRE ATT&amp;CK</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://tryhackme.com/room/mitre\">ATT&amp;CK framework</a> is a knowledge base of adversary behaviour, focusing on the indicators and tactics. Security analysts can use the information to be thorough while investigating and tracking adversarial behaviour.</p>\n<p>Press enter or click to view image in full\u00a0size</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*HIlYG-uIAgVFqwAH.png\"></figure><h3>TAXII</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/taxii/intro\">The Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII)</a> defines protocols for securely exchanging threat intel to have near real-time detection, prevention and mitigation of threats. The protocol supports two sharing\u00a0models:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Collection</strong>: Threat intel is collected and hosted by a producer upon request by users using a request-response model.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Channel</strong>: Threat intel is pushed to users from a central server through a publish-subscribe model.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>STIX</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro\">Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX)</a> is a language developed for the \u201cspecification, capture, characterisation and communication of standardised cyber threat information\u201d. It provides defined relationships between sets of threat info such as observables, indicators, adversary TTPs, attack campaigns, and\u00a0more.</p>\n<h3>Cyber Kill\u00a0Chain</h3>\n<p>Developed by Lockheed Martin, the Cyber Kill Chain breaks down adversary actions into steps. This breakdown helps analysts and defenders identify which stage-specific activities occurred when investigating an attack. The phases defined are shown in the image\u00a0below.</p>\n<p>Press enter or click to view image in full\u00a0size</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*bvb3jWckSk2UZfYo.png\"></figure><p>TechniquePurposeExamplesReconnaissanceObtain information about the victim and the tactics used for the attack.Harvesting emails, OSINT, and social media, network scansWeaponisationMalware is engineered based on the needs and intentions of the attack.Exploit with a backdoor, malicious office documentDeliveryCovers how the malware would be delivered to the victim\u2019s system.Email, weblinks, USBExploitationBreach the victim\u2019s system vulnerabilities to execute code and create scheduled jobs to establish persistence.<br>EternalBlue, Zero-Logon, etc.InstallationInstall malware and other tools to gain access to the victim\u2019s system.Password dumping, backdoors, remote access trojansCommand &amp; ControlRemotely control the compromised system, deliver additional malware, move across valuable assets and elevate privileges.Empire, Cobalt Strike, etc.Actions on ObjectivesFulfil the intended goals for the attack: financial gain, corporate espionage, and data exfiltration.Data encryption, ransomware, public defacement</p>\n<p>Over time, the kill chain has been expanded using other frameworks such as ATT&amp;CK and formulated a new Unified Kill\u00a0Chain.</p>\n<h3>The Diamond\u00a0Model</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/538/0*IjWOLpCy_1CRjg_J.png\"></figure><p>The diamond model looks at intrusion analysis and tracking attack groups over time. It focuses on four key areas, each representing a different point on the diamond. These\u00a0are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Adversary: </strong>The focus here is on the threat actor behind an attack and allows analysts to identify the motive behind the\u00a0attack.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Victim:</strong> The opposite end of adversary looks at an individual, group or organisation affected by an\u00a0attack.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Infrastructure: </strong>The adversaries\u2019 tools, systems, and software to conduct their attack are the main focus. Additionally, the victim\u2019s systems would be crucial to providing information about the compromise.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Capabilities:</strong> The focus here is on the adversary\u2019s approach to reaching its goal. This looks at the means of exploitation and the TTPs implemented across the attack\u00a0timeline</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example of the diamond model in play would involve an adversary targeting a victim using phishing attacks to obtain sensitive information and compromise their system, as displayed on the diagram. As a threat intelligence analyst, the model allows you to pivot along its properties to produce a complete picture of an attack and correlate indicators.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Answer the questions below</em></strong></p>\n<p>4a.

These can be utilised to protect critical assets and inform cyber security teams and management business decisions.</p>\n<p>It would be typical to use the terms \u201cdata\u201d, \u201cinformation\u201d, and \u201cintelligence\u201d interchangeably. However, let us distinguish between them to understand better how CTI comes into\u00a0play.</p>\n<p>Press enter or click to view image in full\u00a0size</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*P_z9Oglcnenq-QfF.png\"></figure><p><strong>Data:</strong> Discrete indicators associated with an adversary, such as IP addresses, URLs or\u00a0hashes.</p>\n<p><strong>Information:</strong> A combination of multiple data points that answer questions such as \u201cHow many times have employees accessed tryhackme.com within the\u00a0month?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Intelligence:</strong> The correlation of data and information to extract patterns of actions based on contextual analysis.</p>\n<p>The primary goal of CTI is to understand the relationship between your operational environment and your adversary and how to defend your environment against any attacks. You would seek this goal by developing your cyber threat context by trying to answer the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who\u2019s attacking you?</li>\n<li>What are their motivations?</li>\n<li>What are their capabilities?</li>\n<li>What artefacts and indicators of compromise (IOCs) should you look out\u00a0for?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these questions, threat intelligence would be gathered from different sources under the following categories:</p>\n<p><strong>Internal:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Corporate security events such as vulnerability assessments and incident response\u00a0reports.</li>\n<li>Cyber awareness training\u00a0reports.</li>\n<li>System logs and\u00a0events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Community:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open web\u00a0forums.</li>\n<li>Dark web communities for cybercriminals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>External</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Threat intel feeds (Commercial &amp; Open-source)</li>\n<li>Online marketplaces.</li>\n<li>Public sources include government data, publications, social media, financial and industrial assessments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Threat Intelligence Classifications</h3>\n<p>Press enter or click to view image in full\u00a0size</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*NmIZ8tJljZ62M7Fa.png\"></figure><p>Threat Intel is geared towards understanding the relationship between your operational environment and your adversary. With this in mind, we can break down threat intel into the following classifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Strategic Intel:</strong> High-level intel that looks into the organisation\u2019s threat landscape and maps out the risk areas based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that may impact business decisions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Technical Intel:</strong> Looks into evidence and artefacts of attack used by an adversary. Incident Response teams can use this intel to create a baseline attack surface to analyse and develop defence mechanisms.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tactical Intel:</strong> Assesses adversaries\u2019 tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This intel can strengthen security controls and address vulnerabilities through real-time investigations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Operational Intel:</strong> Looks into an adversary\u2019s specific motives and intent to perform an attack. Security teams may use this intel to understand the critical assets available in the organisation (people, processes and technologies) that may be targeted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Answer the questions below</em></strong></p>\n<p>2a.

The transformational process follows a six-phase cycle:</p>\n<p>Press enter or click to view image in full\u00a0size</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*qBzxDrKFJfex_4Ib.png\"></figure><h3>Direction</h3>\n<p>Every threat intel program requires to have objectives and goals defined, involving identifying the following parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information assets and business processes that require defending.</li>\n<li>Potential impact to be experienced on losing the assets or through process interruptions.</li>\n<li>Sources of data and intel to be used towards protection.</li>\n<li>Tools and resources that are required to defend the\u00a0assets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This phase also allows security analysts to pose questions related to investigating incidents.</p>\n<h3>Collection</h3>\n<p>Once objectives have been defined, security analysts will gather the required data to address them. Analysts will do this by using commercial, private and open-source resources available. Due to the volume of data analysts usually face, it is recommended to automate this phase to provide time for triaging incidents.</p>\n<h3>Processing</h3>\n<p>Raw logs, vulnerability information, malware and network traffic usually come in different formats and may be disconnected when used to investigate an incident. This phase ensures that the data is extracted, sorted, organised, correlated with appropriate tags and presented visually in a usable and understandable format to the analysts. SIEMs are valuable tools for achieving this and allow quick parsing of\u00a0data.</p>\n<h3>Analysis</h3>\n<p>Once the information aggregation is complete, security analysts must derive insights. Decisions to be made may\u00a0involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investigating a potential threat through uncovering indicators and attack patterns.</li>\n<li>Defining an action plan to avert an attack and defend the infrastructure.</li>\n<li>Strengthening security controls or justifying investment for additional resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dissemination</h3>\n<p>Different organisational stakeholders will consume the intelligence in varying languages and formats. For example, C-suite members will require a concise report covering trends in adversary activities, financial implications and strategic recommendations. At the same time, analysts will more likely inform the technical team about the threat IOCs, adversary TTPs and tactical action\u00a0plans.</p>\n<h3>Feedback</h3>\n<p>The final phase covers the most crucial part, as analysts rely on the responses provided by stakeholders to improve the threat intelligence process and implementation of security controls. Feedback should be regular interaction between teams to keep the lifecycle working.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Answer the questions below</em></strong></p>\n<p>3a.

They also allow for common terminology, which helps in collaboration and communication. Here, we briefly look at some essential standards and frameworks commonly\u00a0used.</p>\n<h3>MITRE ATT&amp;CK</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://tryhackme.com/room/mitre\">ATT&amp;CK framework</a> is a knowledge base of adversary behaviour, focusing on the indicators and tactics. Security analysts can use the information to be thorough while investigating and tracking adversarial behaviour.</p>\n<p>Press enter or click to view image in full\u00a0size</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*HIlYG-uIAgVFqwAH.png\"></figure><h3>TAXII</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/taxii/intro\">The Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII)</a> defines protocols for securely exchanging threat intel to have near real-time detection, prevention and mitigation of threats. The protocol supports two sharing\u00a0models:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Collection</strong>: Threat intel is collected and hosted by a producer upon request by users using a request-response model.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Channel</strong>: Threat intel is pushed to users from a central server through a publish-subscribe model.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>STIX</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro\">Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX)</a> is a language developed for the \u201cspecification, capture, characterisation and communication of standardised cyber threat information\u201d. It provides defined relationships between sets of threat info such as observables, indicators, adversary TTPs, attack campaigns, and\u00a0more.</p>\n<h3>Cyber Kill\u00a0Chain</h3>\n<p>Developed by Lockheed Martin, the Cyber Kill Chain breaks down adversary actions into steps. This breakdown helps analysts and defenders identify which stage-specific activities occurred when investigating an attack. The phases defined are shown in the image\u00a0below.</p>\n<p>Press enter or click to view image in full\u00a0size</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*bvb3jWckSk2UZfYo.png\"></figure><p>TechniquePurposeExamplesReconnaissanceObtain information about the victim and the tactics used for the attack.Harvesting emails, OSINT, and social media, network scansWeaponisationMalware is engineered based on the needs and intentions of the attack.Exploit with a backdoor, malicious office documentDeliveryCovers how the malware would be delivered to the victim\u2019s system.Email, weblinks, USBExploitationBreach the victim\u2019s system vulnerabilities to execute code and create scheduled jobs to establish persistence.<br>EternalBlue, Zero-Logon, etc.InstallationInstall malware and other tools to gain access to the victim\u2019s system.Password dumping, backdoors, remote access trojansCommand &amp; ControlRemotely control the compromised system, deliver additional malware, move across valuable assets and elevate privileges.Empire, Cobalt Strike, etc.Actions on ObjectivesFulfil the intended goals for the attack: financial gain, corporate espionage, and data exfiltration.Data encryption, ransomware, public defacement</p>\n<p>Over time, the kill chain has been expanded using other frameworks such as ATT&amp;CK and formulated a new Unified Kill\u00a0Chain.</p>\n<h3>The Diamond\u00a0Model</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/538/0*IjWOLpCy_1CRjg_J.png\"></figure><p>The diamond model looks at intrusion analysis and tracking attack groups over time. It focuses on four key areas, each representing a different point on the diamond. These\u00a0are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Adversary: </strong>The focus here is on the threat actor behind an attack and allows analysts to identify the motive behind the\u00a0attack.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Victim:</strong> The opposite end of adversary looks at an individual, group or organisation affected by an\u00a0attack.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Infrastructure: </strong>The adversaries\u2019 tools, systems, and software to conduct their attack are the main focus. Additionally, the victim\u2019s systems would be crucial to providing information about the compromise.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Capabilities:</strong> The focus here is on the adversary\u2019s approach to reaching its goal. This looks at the means of exploitation and the TTPs implemented across the attack\u00a0timeline</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example of the diamond model in play would involve an adversary targeting a victim using phishing attacks to obtain sensitive information and compromise their system, as displayed on the diagram. As a threat intelligence analyst, the model allows you to pivot along its properties to produce a complete picture of an attack and correlate indicators.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Answer the questions below</em></strong></p>\n<p>4a.

For example, is the system critical to normal operations, and is a system holding sensitive information like payment info or addresses?<br>2. Assessing what vulnerabilities and weaknesses these systems and applications may have and how they could be potentially exploited<br>3.

For example, a social engineering attack could\u00a0include:</p>\n<p>- Getting a user to open a malicious attachment.<br>- Impersonating a web page and having the user enter their credentials.<br>- Calling or visiting the target and impersonating a user (for example, requesting a password reset) or being able to gain access to areas of a site that the attacker would not previously be capable of (for example, impersonating a utility engineer).</p>\n<p>**Exploitation ([MITRE Tactic TA0002](<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/))**\">https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/))**</a></p>\n<p>This phase of the UKC describes how an attacker takes advantage of weaknesses or vulnerabilities present in a system. The UKC defines \u201cExploitation\u201d as abuse of vulnerabilities to perform code execution. For\u00a0example:</p>\n<p>- Uploading and executing a reverse shell to a web application.<br>- Interfering with an automated script on the system to execute code.<br>- Abusing a web application vulnerability to execute code on the system it is running\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>**Persistence ([MITRE Tactic TA0003](<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/))**\">https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/))**</a></p>\n<p>This phase of the UKC is rather short and simple. Specifically, this phase of the UKC describes the techniques an adversary uses to maintain access to a system they have gained an initial foothold on. For\u00a0example:</p>\n<p>- Creating a service on the target system that will allow the attacker to regain access.<br>- Adding the target system to a Command &amp; Control server where commands can be executed remotely at any time.<br>- Leaving other forms of backdoors that execute when a certain action occurs on the system (i.e. a reverse shell will execute when a system administrator logs\u00a0in).</p>\n<p>**Defence Evasion ([MITRE Tactic TA0005](<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/))**\">https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/))**</a></p>\n<p>The \u201cDefence Evasion\u201d section of the UKC is one of the more valuable phases of the UKC. This phase specifically is used to understand the techniques an adversary uses to evade defensive measures put in place in the system or network. For example, this could\u00a0be:</p>\n<p>- Web application firewalls.<br>- Network firewalls.<br>- Anti-virus systems on the target machine.<br>- Intrusion detection systems.</p>\n<p>This phase is valuable when analysing an attack as it helps form a response and better yet\u200a\u2014\u200agives the defensive team information on how they can improve their defence systems in the\u00a0future.</p>\n<p>**Command &amp; Control ([MITRE Tactic TA0011](<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/))**\">https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/))**</a></p>\n<p>The \u201cCommand &amp; Control\u201d phase of the UKC combines the efforts an adversary made during the \u201cWeaponization\u201d stage of the UKC to establish communications between the adversary and target\u00a0system.</p>\n<p>An adversary can establish command and control of a target system to achieve its action on objectives. For example, the adversary can:</p>\n<p>- Execute commands.<br>- Steal data, credentials and other information.<br>- Use the controlled server to pivot to other systems on the\u00a0network.</p>\n<p>**Pivoting ([MITRE Tactic TA0008](<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/))**\">https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/))**</a></p>\n<p>\u201cPivoting\u201d is the technique an adversary uses to reach other systems within a network that are not otherwise accessible (for example, they are not exposed to the internet). There are often many systems in a network that are not directly reachable and often contain valuable data or have weaker security.</p>\n<p>For example, an adversary can gain access to a web server that is publically accessible to attack other systems that are within the same network (but are not accessible via the internet).</p>\n<p>What is an example of a tactic to gain a foothold using\u00a0emails?</p>\n<p>Ans\u00a0:\u00a0Phishing</p>\n<p>Impersonating an employee to request a password reset is a form of\u00a0what?</p>\n<p>Ans\u00a0: Social Engineering</p>\n<p>An adversary setting up the Command &amp; Control server infrastructure is what phase of the Unified Kill\u00a0Chain?</p>\n<p>Ans\u00a0: Weaponization</p>\n<p>Exploiting a vulnerability present on a system is what phase of the Unified Kill\u00a0Chain?</p>\n<p>Ans\u00a0: Exploitation</p>\n<p>Moving from one system to another is an example\u00a0of?</p>\n<p>Ans\u00a0:\u00a0Pivoting</p>\n<p>Leaving behind a malicious service that allows the adversary to log back into the target is\u00a0what?</p>\n<p>Ans\u00a0: Persistence</p>\n<h4>## Phase: Through (Network Propagation)</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wLEyRCq-NLSBnyQeu7s4ZA.png\"></figure><p>This phase follows a successful foothold being established on the target network.

Within this stage, the knowledge base would be built from the active user accounts, the permissions granted, applications and software in use, web browser activity, files, directories and network shares, and system configurations.</p>\n<p>#### **Privilege Escalation** ([MITRE Tactic TA0004](<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/\">https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/</a>))</p>\n<p>Following their knowledge-gathering, the adversary would try to gain more prominent permissions within the pivot system. They would leverage the information on the accounts present with vulnerabilities and misconfigurations found to elevate their access to one of the following superior\u00a0levels:</p>\n<p>- _SYSTEM/ ROOT._<br>- _Local Administrator._<br>- _A user account with Admin-like access._<br>- _A user account with specific access or functions._</p>\n<h4>#### **Execution** ([MITRE Tactic TA0002](<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/\">https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/</a>))</h4>\n<p>This is where they deploy their malicious code using the pivot system as their host.

For example, a social engineering attack could\u00a0include:</p>\n<p>- Getting a user to open a malicious attachment.<br>- Impersonating a web page and having the user enter their credentials.<br>- Calling or visiting the target and impersonating a user (for example, requesting a password reset) or being able to gain access to areas of a site that the attacker would not previously be capable of (for example, impersonating a utility engineer).</p>\n<p>**Exploitation ([MITRE Tactic TA0002](<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/))**\">https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/))**</a></p>\n<p>This phase of the UKC describes how an attacker takes advantage of weaknesses or vulnerabilities present in a system. The UKC defines \u201cExploitation\u201d as abuse of vulnerabilities to perform code execution. For\u00a0example:</p>\n<p>- Uploading and executing a reverse shell to a web application.<br>- Interfering with an automated script on the system to execute code.<br>- Abusing a web application vulnerability to execute code on the system it is running\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>**Persistence ([MITRE Tactic TA0003](<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/))**\">https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/))**</a></p>\n<p>This phase of the UKC is rather short and simple. Specifically, this phase of the UKC describes the techniques an adversary uses to maintain access to a system they have gained an initial foothold on. For\u00a0example:</p>\n<p>- Creating a service on the target system that will allow the attacker to regain access.<br>- Adding the target system to a Command &amp; Control server where commands can be executed remotely at any time.<br>- Leaving other forms of backdoors that execute when a certain action occurs on the system (i.e. a reverse shell will execute when a system administrator logs\u00a0in).</p>\n<p>**Defence Evasion ([MITRE Tactic TA0005](<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/))**\">https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/))**</a></p>\n<p>The \u201cDefence Evasion\u201d section of the UKC is one of the more valuable phases of the UKC. This phase specifically is used to understand the techniques an adversary uses to evade defensive measures put in place in the system or network. For example, this could\u00a0be:</p>\n<p>- Web application firewalls.<br>- Network firewalls.<br>- Anti-virus systems on the target machine.<br>- Intrusion detection systems.</p>\n<p>This phase is valuable when analysing an attack as it helps form a response and better yet\u200a\u2014\u200agives the defensive team information on how they can improve their defence systems in the\u00a0future.</p>\n<p>**Command &amp; Control ([MITRE Tactic TA0011](<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/))**\">https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/))**</a></p>\n<p>The \u201cCommand &amp; Control\u201d phase of the UKC combines the efforts an adversary made during the \u201cWeaponization\u201d stage of the UKC to establish communications between the adversary and target\u00a0system.</p>\n<p>An adversary can establish command and control of a target system to achieve its action on objectives. For example, the adversary can:</p>\n<p>- Execute commands.<br>- Steal data, credentials and other information.<br>- Use the controlled server to pivot to other systems on the\u00a0network.</p>\n<p>**Pivoting ([MITRE Tactic TA0008](<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/))**\">https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/))**</a></p>\n<p>\u201cPivoting\u201d is the technique an adversary uses to reach other systems within a network that are not otherwise accessible (for example, they are not exposed to the internet). There are often many systems in a network that are not directly reachable and often contain valuable data or have weaker security.</p>\n<p>For example, an adversary can gain access to a web server that is publically accessible to attack other systems that are within the same network (but are not accessible via the internet).</p>\n<p>What is an example of a tactic to gain a foothold using\u00a0emails?</p>\n<p>Ans\u00a0:\u00a0Phishing</p>\n<p>Impersonating an employee to request a password reset is a form of\u00a0what?</p>\n<p>Ans\u00a0: Social Engineering</p>\n<p>An adversary setting up the Command &amp; Control server infrastructure is what phase of the Unified Kill\u00a0Chain?</p>\n<p>Ans\u00a0: Weaponization</p>\n<p>Exploiting a vulnerability present on a system is what phase of the Unified Kill\u00a0Chain?</p>\n<p>Ans\u00a0: Exploitation</p>\n<p>Moving from one system to another is an example\u00a0of?</p>\n<p>Ans\u00a0:\u00a0Pivoting</p>\n<p>Leaving behind a malicious service that allows the adversary to log back into the target is\u00a0what?</p>\n<p>Ans\u00a0: Persistence</p>\n<h4>## Phase: Through (Network Propagation)</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wLEyRCq-NLSBnyQeu7s4ZA.png\"></figure><p>This phase follows a successful foothold being established on the target network.

The system would also be used as the distribution point for all malware and backdoors at later\u00a0stages.</p>\n<p>#### **Discovery** ([MITRE Tactic TA0007](<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/\">https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/</a>))</p>\n<p>The adversary would uncover information about the system and the network it is connected to. Within this stage, the knowledge base would be built from the active user accounts, the permissions granted, applications and software in use, web browser activity, files, directories and network shares, and system configurations.</p>\n<p>#### **Privilege Escalation** ([MITRE Tactic TA0004](<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/\">https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/</a>))</p>\n<p>Following their knowledge-gathering, the adversary would try to gain more prominent permissions within the pivot system. They would leverage the information on the accounts present with vulnerabilities and misconfigurations found to elevate their access to one of the following superior\u00a0levels:</p>\n<p>- _SYSTEM/ ROOT._<br>- _Local Administrator._<br>- _A user account with Admin-like access._<br>- _A user account with specific access or functions._</p>\n<h4>#### **Execution** ([MITRE Tactic TA0002](<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/\">https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/</a>))</h4>\n<p>This is where they deploy their malicious code using the pivot system as their host.

Here's a roadmap that\u00a0works.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>1. Understand What Cybersecurity Really\u00a0Is</strong></p>\n<p>Cybersecurity is more than just \u201chacking.\u201d It\u2019s the practice of protecting computers, networks, and data from digital\u00a0attacks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Key areas\u00a0include:</li>\n<li>Network Security</li>\n<li>Cloud Security</li>\n<li>Application Security</li>\n<li>Ethical Hacking (Penetration Testing)</li>\n<li>Digital Forensics</li>\n<li>Threat Intelligence</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Start exploring free resources like:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>TryHackMe</li>\n<li>Cybrary</li>\n<li>YouTube (search for \u201cCybersecurity for Beginners\u201d)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>2. Learn the Fundamentals (No Degree Required)</strong></p>\n<p>Before diving into hacking tools or certifications, you\u2019ll need to grasp the\u00a0basics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How computers and networks\u00a0work</li>\n<li>Operating systems (Linux and\u00a0Windows)</li>\n<li>Basic networking concepts (IP addresses, DNS, firewalls)</li>\n<li>Cybersecurity terminology (malware, phishing, encryption)</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Cw51nHlmo-OpYY0rOVbq_g.jpeg\"></figure><p><strong>Free learning\u00a0paths:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google IT Support Professional Certificate (on Coursera)</li>\n<li>CompTIA ITF+ or Security+ study materials</li>\n<li>Khan Academy\u2019s security\u00a0modules</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>3. Get Hands-On Experience</strong></p>\n<p>Theory is great\u2014but practice makes a cybersecurity pro.</p>\n<p>Where to\u00a0start:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install a virtual lab (VirtualBox + Kali Linux +\u00a0Windows)</li>\n<li>TryHackMe and Hack The Box: Learn by solving real-world security challenges.</li>\n<li>Use free tools: Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, and Burp\u00a0Suite.</li>\n<li>Practice writing simple bash or PowerShell scripts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>4. Choose Your Cybersecurity Path</strong></p>\n<p>Cybersecurity isn\u2019t a single job. Here are a few paths you can\u00a0explore:</p>\n<p>Role\tFocus\u00a0Area</p>\n<p>SOC Analyst\tMonitor and respond to alerts<br>Penetration Tester\tEthical hacking<br>Cloud Security Engineer\tSecure cloud infrastructure<br>GRC Analyst\tPolicy, compliance, risk<br>Threat Hunter\tActively hunt for threats in\u00a0systems</p>\n<p>Use this cybersecurity roadmap to map out your\u00a0path.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>5. Earn Certifications (But Don't Overdo\u00a0It)</strong></p>\n<p>Certifications validate your knowledge\u2014but they're not everything. Focus on these as a beginner:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CompTIA Security+ \u2013 great starting\u00a0point</li>\n<li>eJPT \u2013 for aspiring ethical\u00a0hackers</li>\n<li>Google Cybersecurity Certificate \u2013 beginner-friendly and affordable</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Don\u2019t stack certs without hands-on experience.

The good news? You don\u2019t need to be a tech genius or have a computer science degree to get\u00a0started.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HFQHnv6YqztzGTMJYIrR-g.jpeg\"></figure><p>If you're curious, determined, and willing to learn, you can break into this field. Here's a roadmap that\u00a0works.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>1. Understand What Cybersecurity Really\u00a0Is</strong></p>\n<p>Cybersecurity is more than just \u201chacking.\u201d It\u2019s the practice of protecting computers, networks, and data from digital\u00a0attacks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Key areas\u00a0include:</li>\n<li>Network Security</li>\n<li>Cloud Security</li>\n<li>Application Security</li>\n<li>Ethical Hacking (Penetration Testing)</li>\n<li>Digital Forensics</li>\n<li>Threat Intelligence</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Start exploring free resources like:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>TryHackMe</li>\n<li>Cybrary</li>\n<li>YouTube (search for \u201cCybersecurity for Beginners\u201d)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>2. Learn the Fundamentals (No Degree Required)</strong></p>\n<p>Before diving into hacking tools or certifications, you\u2019ll need to grasp the\u00a0basics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How computers and networks\u00a0work</li>\n<li>Operating systems (Linux and\u00a0Windows)</li>\n<li>Basic networking concepts (IP addresses, DNS, firewalls)</li>\n<li>Cybersecurity terminology (malware, phishing, encryption)</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Cw51nHlmo-OpYY0rOVbq_g.jpeg\"></figure><p><strong>Free learning\u00a0paths:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google IT Support Professional Certificate (on Coursera)</li>\n<li>CompTIA ITF+ or Security+ study materials</li>\n<li>Khan Academy\u2019s security\u00a0modules</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>3. Get Hands-On Experience</strong></p>\n<p>Theory is great\u2014but practice makes a cybersecurity pro.</p>\n<p>Where to\u00a0start:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install a virtual lab (VirtualBox + Kali Linux +\u00a0Windows)</li>\n<li>TryHackMe and Hack The Box: Learn by solving real-world security challenges.</li>\n<li>Use free tools: Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, and Burp\u00a0Suite.</li>\n<li>Practice writing simple bash or PowerShell scripts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>4. Choose Your Cybersecurity Path</strong></p>\n<p>Cybersecurity isn\u2019t a single job. Here are a few paths you can\u00a0explore:</p>\n<p>Role\tFocus\u00a0Area</p>\n<p>SOC Analyst\tMonitor and respond to alerts<br>Penetration Tester\tEthical hacking<br>Cloud Security Engineer\tSecure cloud infrastructure<br>GRC Analyst\tPolicy, compliance, risk<br>Threat Hunter\tActively hunt for threats in\u00a0systems</p>\n<p>Use this cybersecurity roadmap to map out your\u00a0path.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>5. Earn Certifications (But Don't Overdo\u00a0It)</strong></p>\n<p>Certifications validate your knowledge\u2014but they're not everything. Focus on these as a beginner:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CompTIA Security+ \u2013 great starting\u00a0point</li>\n<li>eJPT \u2013 for aspiring ethical\u00a0hackers</li>\n<li>Google Cybersecurity Certificate \u2013 beginner-friendly and affordable</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Don\u2019t stack certs without hands-on experience. Employers value real skills more than just\u00a0paper.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>6. Build Your\u00a0Presence</strong></p>\n<p>Want to stand out? Start building your\u00a0brand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Share your learning journey on\u00a0LinkedIn</li>\n<li>Write blog posts or document labs on\u00a0GitHub</li>\n<li>Compete in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions</li>\n<li>Join cybersecurity Discords, Reddit forums, or\u00a0meetups</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Show your passion, not just your\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>7.

It\u2019s a CTF, the chances that the final ingredient are in root are very likely,\u00a0right?</li>\n<li>I tried a bunch of commands to show the root directory but none worked. It occurred to me that I should be using sudo while attempting to list the root directory using sudo ls /root\u00a0-al</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/875/0*NQDkgDPgZZK6BqXH.png\"><figcaption>root directory</figcaption></figure><ul>\n<li>Here is a 3rd.txt file. Interesting! I erased the ls /root -al and replaced with less /root/3rd.txt (keeping sudo for elevated privileges). Try on your\u00a0end!</li>\n<li>CTF Complete!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for reading.
